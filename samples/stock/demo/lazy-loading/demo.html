<div class="info">In this example Highcharts' data grouping is turned off. Instead, new data 
	with a suitable resolution is loaded from the server every time the
	extremes of the x axis change.</div>


<pre>
To do lazy-loading

- Range selector buttons not taking the pressed state. This, along with the minPadding and maxPadding issue, should be solved by preventing setData from resetting the extremes on the x axis when there are userMin and userMax
- loading data after Sep 30 is impossible though there is data on the server
- fails on ordinal when zooming in too narrow
- Make cache tables on the server

Problem 1:
This code, in StockNavigation.js, always runs because stickToMin is always true because we are loading data within the previous range. This causes the second
setExtremes: 
- baseXAxis.setExtremes(newMin, newMax, true, false);
